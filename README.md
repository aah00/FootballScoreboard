# FootballScoreboard
A simple c++ based library to show all the ongoing matches and their scores.

The scoreboard supports the following operations:
- Start a new game, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard.
This should capture following parameters:
  - Home team
  - Away team
- Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away
team score.
- Finish game currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
- Get a summary of games in progress ordered by their total score. The games with the same
total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the scoreboard.
